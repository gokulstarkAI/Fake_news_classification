# Fake_news_classification
A model to classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.
This python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, I build a TfidfVectorizer on the dataset. Then I Initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
# Result
* So with this model I get a Accuracy of 92.82%.
* With confusion matrix I get 590 true positive, 586 true negative, 48 false positive and 43 false negative.
