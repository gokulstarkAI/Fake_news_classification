# Fake_news_classification
A model to classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.
This python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on the dataset. Then we Initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
